    <h1>Rainbow Amidst Chaos -  Dhaka</h1>
    <h4>July, 2024</h4>

        Rainbows have always fascinated me, but it's hard to spot them in a crowded city like Dhaka unless you go to a
        high rooftop. Fortunately, the place I live in has 8 floors, which isn't much, but compared to other buildings
        around our block, it's tall.

        The last two weeks have been hectic in Bangladesh due to protests by students for quota reformation in
        government jobs. The resulting unrest forced the government to halt the internet connection to stop the mass
        chaos throughout the country. Like other professionals, my work life came to a standstill without the internet.
        So, I started living like a school kid: studying and reading books, playing downloaded video games on my PC,
        playing garage football and rooftop cricket, flying kites, and more.

        Since the government imposed a curfew, I spent most of my time inside our compound and didn't go outside. It
        became a routine to visit the rooftop in the afternoon to play cricket or fly kites regularly. Out of nowhere, I
        saw this amazing full rainbow. Somehow, it gave me a sense of relief from the chaotic world we are living in
        right now. Hopefully, everything will calm down soon.
