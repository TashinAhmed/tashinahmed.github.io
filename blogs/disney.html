        With lots of confusion and thoughts, decided to move Japan after all. The new workplace respecting me even
        though I am from Bangladesh, don't know Japanese at all, and all other cons. Knew it will be tough, and feeling
        the heat as well, but most of it absorbed by my cousin (Shiplu bhai) and his family (Rima bhabi and newphew
        Rafid). Without their full support things might become 1K% more challenging to me. Till now I am facing lots of
        hurdles that requires their continuos attention. As I don't even came with a help of any agency have to bear my
        own shit. Thankful to <a href="https://www.cross-compass.com/en">Cross Compass</a> as well for their continuos
        support on guaranting my new home, providing free Japanese language course, giving hybrid work opportunity,
        flexible clock in out timing and each and every matter. it's quite rare from the perspective of a Japanese
        company.

        First few days in a new country tends to be called as Honeymoon period. Same goes for me as well. Although I
        didn't wanted that as I don't want to feel sad after the period ends. But my cousin have different idea. He and
        his family took me to the Tokyo Disneyland after moving to their house. How was that? First I thought it's a
        pure waste of money, but after enjoying few rides and enjoying the parades and the environment - it worths every
        Â¥Â¥Â¥ and no wonder why this is the best planned Disneyland out of 6. Don't want to give any spoiler but you can
        see all the rides and have glimpse from social medias. But trust me, watching them in videos and experiencing
        them is out of the world different. A new ride got added to the Tokyo Disneyland on Beauty & The Beast. Waited
        around 80 mins to enjoy the ride and it worth it. In general it takes more than 60 mins to enjoy single ride but
        in our case the weather was foul thus presence of people was low so we had a chance to enjoy most of the major
        rides. Cutting it short, I was lucky and thankful to my cousins family gifting me such a present after moving to
        a new non English speaking country and limiting the culture shock.
