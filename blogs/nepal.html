        First journey to abroad is always special for someone, same for me. me and my mother never went outside the
        country before. Neither did we rid airplanes. So, this was our chance back in 2022 to fill up the bucket list
        for the
        very first time. Although my father couldn't join because of his expired passport. As I took my mother and she
        got old
        by age till now, I didn't wanted to take any chance of hotel booking, ride facilities hassle after reaching a
        new land.
        So I prebooked all the destination hotels, taxi facilities for tourist, and other commutes. It helped a lot but
        cost a
        bit more than usual. But you have to trade off something if you want to give a relax tour equivalent to a 4
        start I guess.

        First impression at Dhaka Airport was, man it seems quite large from outside but it's a small airport, and in
        some sense
        I felt like it is smaller than my school was. Yeah I was fortunate enough to study in a school with moderately
        larger campus
        inside Dhaka city. But soon that deemed after landing at Tribhuban International Airport. That was much smaller
        than Dhaka Airport,
        probably thrice. Before that, about first airplane ride, truly speaking, I didn't feel anything at all. Air
        hostess provided some papers
        to fill up, I was filling those and the plane took off. My mother was trembling a bit and after reaching Dhaka
        she told us that she was afraid
        for few minutes but after a while, she commanded her mind that the things at the sky is not under her control
        and even anything goes wrong
        she has to embrace it anyway.

        After a saltless plane ride we took our prebooked ride to the hotel at Thamel, Kathmandu. I didn't liked that
        Thamel street at all
        as it was too narrow and with overpriced E V E R Y T H I N G. It gave us a vibe of Old Dhaka. A free tip: Don't
        buy anything
        from there if you don't want to. Buy sim card from airport because outside the airport even in Thamel street,
        local vendors will
        try to scam you with used sim cards. Yeah, like Bangladesh they got a good business of old sim cards as well.
        Enough negative talks,
        you can visit Durbar Square over there at Kathmandu, btw there are few Durbar Squares over there in KTM, to be
        exact, 3. And also some hindu temples outside
        Durbar Square as well, with tolls of monkey armies. As a Muslim, I didn't like to visit those temples as all the
        temples were quite busy at that time
        and they were performing their rituals. Although if I visit Nepal again I want to visit the main Durbar Square
        at night. 
        
        At the
        temple of Pasupathinath there are lots of monekys who loves to tease people. I witnessed a bridal photography
        taking place
        at some stairways and a monkey cheated the bride and took her veils and ran off, and the photography team and
        groom started chasing the monkey and
        a war between humans and monkey kind of broke off. Didn't know what happened after that as I ran off immediately
        from that sector. Thamel don't have much to offer unfortunately. At least to me.

        On the other hand, Pokahara is a dynamic place with all those activities like paragliding, bungie jumping and
        others, with a beautiful Phewa Lake inside the city, this is the place where everyone wants to go when they
        visit Nepal. Although the car distance from Kathmunudu to Pokahra is around 7/8 hours which is really tiring.
        Although Nepal govt. is fixing their snake like roads in between all those hills, hopefully it will cut around
        2/3 hours of travel time. Another way to travel to Pokahara within minutes is airplane. But internal air
        services is still a bit unsafe in Nepal. If you visit near Phewa lake the best timing will be at dawn or at
        evening. The bank of the lake is always festive. You can hire boats of different sizes from there. A small note:
        The lake is sacred to the locals, and diving in the lake is prohibited. So, don't dive in if you don't want to
        put yourself in trouble. In Nepal, whereever you go, you will find a temple. In Phewa Lake, there is a small
        island in the middle and you will find a temple over there as well. If you are lucky you will be able to see the
        Himalayan Range from the bank of the lake. Amazingly, hot air balloon ride is also available there.
